Straw!
Faster!
Mud and lift!
Sand and pull!
Water and raise up!
Straw!
Faster!
With the sting of the whip on my shoulder
With the salt of my sweat on my brow
Elohim, God on high, can you hear your people cry?
Help us now
This dark hour
Deliver us
Hear our call, deliver us
Lord of all, remember us
Here in this burning sand
Deliver us
There's a land You promised us
Deliver us to the Promised Land
ילדי הטוב והרך
אל תירא ואל תפחד
My son, I have nothing I can give
But this chance that you may live
I pray we'll meet again if He will
Deliver us (deliver us)
Hear our prayer, deliver us
From despair, these years of slavery
Grown too cruel to stand
Deliver us
There's a land You promised us
Deliver us from the bondage
And deliver us to the Promised Land

Be gay^ slay
