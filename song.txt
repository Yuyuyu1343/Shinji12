Mud!
Sand!
Water!
Straw!
Faster!
Mud and lift!
Sand and pull!
Water and raise up!
Straw!
Faster!
With the sting of the whip on my shoulder
With the salt of my sweat on my brow
Elohim, God on high, can you hear your people cry?
Help us now
This dark hour
Deliver us
Hear our call, deliver us
Lord of all, remember us
Here in this burning sand
Deliver us
There's a land You promised us
Deliver us to the Promised Land
ילדי הטוב והרך
אל תירא ואל תפחד
My son, I have nothing I can give
But this chance that you may live
I pray we'll meet again if He will
Deliver us (deliver us)
Hear our prayer, deliver us
From despair, these years of slavery
Grown too cruel to stand
Deliver us
There's a land You promised us
Deliver us from the bondage
And deliver us to the Promised Land

Be gay^ slay
Gender? No^ not after how he treated Shinji.

Hush now my baby, be still, love, don't cry
Sleep as you're rocked by the stream
Sleep and remember my last lullaby
So I'll be with you when you dream
River, oh, river, flow gently for me
Such precious cargo you bear
Do you know somewhere he can live free?
River, deliver him there
Hee-eee
Hee-eee
Brother, you're safe now and safe may you stay
For I have a prayer just for you
Grow, baby brother, come back someday
Come and deliver us, too
Deliver us
Send a shepherd to shepherd us
And deliver us to the Promised Land
Deliver us to the Promised Land
Deliver us
